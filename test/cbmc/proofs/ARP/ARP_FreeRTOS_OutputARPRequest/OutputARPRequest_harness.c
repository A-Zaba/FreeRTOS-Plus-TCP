 * We assume that the pxGetNetworkBufferWithDescriptor function is
 * implemented correctly and returns a valid data structure.
 * This is the mock to mimic the expected behavior.
 * If this allocation fails, this might invalidate the proof.
 * FreeRTOS_OutputARPRequest calls pxGetNetworkBufferWithDescriptor
 * to get a NetworkBufferDescriptor. Then it calls vARPGenerateRequestPacket
 * passing this buffer along in the function call. vARPGenerateRequestPacket
 * casts the pointer xNetworkBuffer.pucEthernetBuffer into an ARPPacket_t
 * pointer and writes a complete ARPPacket to it. Therefore the buffer has to be
 * at least of the size of an ARPPacket to guarantee memory safety.
